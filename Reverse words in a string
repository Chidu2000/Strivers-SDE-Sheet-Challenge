def reverseString(str: str) -> str:   
    return " ".join(str.split()[::-1])


NOTE: The string that will be outputted should not contain trailing white spaces at either ends, and the multiple spaces between two words of a string will be omitted keeping a single space
     and the reverse operation should happen with words and not with every character in that word of a string.
